# Project Description

Soil-Ent-Green uses a Raspberry pi (3b+) and sensors to retrieve the soil moisture level of a potted plant (or anything else), and send this data to a Firestore NoSQL database for storage. A React web application retrieves, graphs, and disiplay this information for the user.

This is the JavaScript/React side of the application.  The Python (Raspberry pi) application can be found [here](https://github.com/CodingMoore/soil-ent-green-python)
